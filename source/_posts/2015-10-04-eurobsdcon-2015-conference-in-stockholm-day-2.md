Day 2
-----

I know most of his stuff but listening to Kirk McKusick is always funny as he has a lot of stories to tell about all these days a Berkeley :) — This time it was about the history of the {% wp Unix_File_System "BSD Fast File System" %}.

Next was the talk by Baptiste Daroussin about the tool called *Poudrière* (yes, it means powder keg) that is used by both FreeBSD and DragonflyBSD to build all the binary packages for ports.  You just can't do better as a `/bin/sh`-based tool with high parallelism.

After lunch, on with the two talks I'm chairing this afternoon, "The State of the graphic stack in DragonflyBSD" by François Tigeot and the report on the [FreeBSD Foundation](https://www.freebsdfoundation.org/) by Deb Goodkind & Ed Maste.

The last two parts of the conference are another keynote and the closing session, with the eagerly awaited disclosure of the next EuroBSDCon's location.
