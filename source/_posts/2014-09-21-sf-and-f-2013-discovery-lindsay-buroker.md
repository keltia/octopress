It is no secret that I like Science Fiction & Fantasy (my [Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3581338-ollivier) shows that :)) and I like classical authors such as [Michael Moorcock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moorcock){% fnin %}I met him three years ago see [these pictures](http://assets.keltia.net/photos/Moorcock-2012) {% endfnin %} , [Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov) and of course [J.R.R. Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien).  I'm not reading only these of course and my list of authors has been growing over the years.

One genre I've been reading into lately is [steampunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk) which mix steam-powered machinery with special things such as post-apocaliptic world or magic.

Although it has been here for a long time ([Jules Verne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne) and [H. G. Wells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells) being well-known in this area), I haven't been seeing the term that much until recently when some new authors got into the genre and one of them I discovered in 2013 is [Lindsay Buroker](http://www.lindsayburoker.com/).

She started back in 2010 (as a self-published author) with [The Emperor's Edge](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10031259-the-emperor-s-edge) (starting book the same series) and has now written more both in this series and in others like [Flash Gold Chronicles](https://www.goodreads.com/series/66572-flash-gold-chronicles) and [Dragon Blood](https://www.goodreads.com/series/129138-dragon-blood).

I enjoyed these books a lot, there is a lot of humour, the stories are well-balanced (even the "romance" part is not so present as to shadow the plot) and the characters are very attaching (even the bad guys).  Compared to many authors I know (I'm looking at you G.R.R. Martin!{% fnin %}Please do not kill Tyrion, please please pretty please {% endfnin %}), she also write books in matter of months not yearsâ€¦

Her series include:

- [The Emperor's Edge](https://www.goodreads.com/series/66385-the-emperor-s-edge)

- [Encrypted](https://www.goodreads.com/series/97364-encrypted)

- [Flash Gold Chronicles](https://www.goodreads.com/series/66572-flash-gold-chronicles)

- [Dragon Blood](https://www.goodreads.com/series/129138-dragon-blood)

- [Rust & Relics](https://www.goodreads.com/series/114556-rust-relics) - #2 is coming in october 2014!

She is also very active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GoblinWriter) so do not hesitate to follow her and discuss, she is very friendly!  Lots of interesting discussions, especially on the subject of self-publishing.

More on authors to come!
