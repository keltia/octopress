Last day of the [EuroBSDCon 2014]() conference (ok, there are only two days anyway :)) with all three tracks as yesterday, another keynote and the closing session where the next EuroBSDCon host is traditionally announced.

Like yesterday, I only chaired some talks so I'm going to talk only about the ones I followed.
<!--more-->
We start pretty fast with [Baptiste Daroussin's](http://2014.eurobsdcon.org/talks-and-schedule/talks/#BaptisteDaroussin) talk about cross-building the FreeBSD ports system with quite a load of specific issues depending on the ported software (usual culprits being Perl and Python, OpenJDK being the unexpected good neighbour).

Then [Ted Unangst's](http://2014.eurobsdcon.org/talks-and-schedule/talks/#TedUnangst1) talk about [LibreSSL](http://libressl.org/) status after a few months after their fork of [OpenSSL](http://openssl.org/), less technical than [Bob Beck](https://www.bsdcan.org/2014/schedule/events/520.en.html)'s talk at [BSDCan](http://bsdcan.org/) but still interesting for the audit they made.

[Theo Deraadt](http://2014.eurobsdcon.org/talks-and-schedule/talks/#TheodeRaadt) was next, speaking on the birth and life of `arc4random(3)` in [OpenBSD](http://openbsd.org/), describing the various algorithms used behind that.

(yes, he is still using that MS Comic Sans compatible font, my eyes are always bleeding even though I know they do it on purpose).

Shawn Webb ([@lattera](https://twitter.com/littera) on Twitter) was next, giving an updated version of his [BSDCan](http://www.bsdcan.org/2014/schedule/events/452.en.html) talk on introducing {% wp Address_space_layout_randomization "ALSR" %} in FreeBSD.  He needs help on other architectures!

Shawn is also the spiritual "father" of Groff the goat :)

Ed Maste gave us an update on [LLDB on FreeBSD](http://2014.eurobsdcon.org/talks-and-schedule/talks/#EdMaste) with an insightful description of the history of gdb as well.

Finally, [Dag-Erling Smøgrav](http://2014.eurobsdcon.org/talks-and-schedule/talks/#DagErlingSmorgrav) described the system they use in the University of Oslo to secure access to sensitive & personal data used mainly for medical purposes.

We also had a final [keynote](http://2014.eurobsdcon.org/talks-and-schedule/talks/#AtanasChobanov) on how to submit documents anonymously, something fundamental for journalists and their sources (think whistleblowing and investigations in post-Wikileaks and Snowden era). Using {% wp SecureDrop %}, [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) and [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/).

Last but not least, the closing session!

Short presentation about the [FreeBSD Foundation](http://freebsdfoundation.org/) by Deb Goodkin (staff, projects, fund raising and so on).  Philip Paeps (also known as *Trouble*) won the book! ("[FreeBSD Design and Implementation, 2nd Edition](http://www.informit.com/store/design-and-implementation-of-the-freebsd-operating-9780321968975?c3ch=LinkShare&c3nid=NZS3W7D*uS0)").

Google did its giveaway (the "raffle") of an ACER Chromebook.

Shteryana Shopova & Paul Schenkeveld did the presentation on the EuroBSDCon Foundation and the place of the next EuroBSDCon is…

An enormous thank to Shteryana "syrinx" Shopova for hosting this great conference.
