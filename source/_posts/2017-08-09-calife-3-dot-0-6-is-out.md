Minor upgrade for [Calife](https://www.keltia.net/programs/calife/), now at 3.0.6.  Some cleanup & refactoring of the code.  Better diagnostics when `fork(2)` fails.  New header file to have better declarations like for `die()`, courtesy of Bertrand Petit.

It is available on my [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/keltia/calife/downloads) and [Gibhub](https://github.com/keltia/calife/releases) repositories.  There is a `fingerprints` file signed with my {% wp GNU_Privacy_Guard GPG %} key.  Please, check the signature before using the files. BTW, the GPG key is [here](https://www.keltia.net/keys/8BE879B028731E1C.asc)

It is now-ish in the FreeBSD ports tree.
