The Imitation Game
------------------
Everybody (maybe even the dog{% fnin %}Old joke that goes generally as "Everybody and his dog…"{% endfnin %}) is speaking of the 2015 movies called [The Imitation Game](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/) with Benjamin Cumberbatch starring as {% wp Alan_Turing "Alan Turing" %} but how many really know him?

For many people, Alan Turing is one of the fathers of the modern computer (along with {% wp John_von_Neumann "John Von Neumann" %} and rightfully so.  What they need to know and what the movie is trying to do (I have yet to see it) is to show how influential he was.

Bletchley Park
--------------
Alan Turing was one of the many people working at {% wp Bletchley Park "Bletchley Park" %}, a secret facility created by {% wp Government_Communications_Headquarters "GCHQ" %} to break the German cipher machine called the {% wp Enigma_machine "Enigma" %}.  He helped improve the Polish electrical machine called the {% wp Bombe "Bombe" %}, designed to rapidly explore the different possibilities of daily encryption keys used by the Germans and find the rotor's wirings.

During his time at Bletchley Park, he also designed the first real computer, {% wp Colossus "Colossus" %} which was used to break another German cipher, the { % wp Lorenz_cipher "Lorenz ciphermachine" %}.

Ihad the pleasure to visit Bletchley Park in 2012 during a [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org/) developers' summit.  On our last day, we took the bus from Cambridge and got to BP.  What a wonderful day!

Here are some (haha) pictures of [Bletchley Park](http://assets.keltia.net/photos/Bletchley-Park/) with the Enigma, the Colossus and the Park itself.

David Kahn wrote a lot about the Enigma in "The Codebreakers" and more specifically in "Seizing the Enigma", although I think that some GCHQ information was still classified when he wrote the former in 1967.

The Turing Test
---------------
Alan Turing is also known for the {% wp Turing_test "Turing Test" %}, an experiment to determine the capability of a machine to have intelligent behavior, like or close enough to a human's, as part of his ongoing work on Artificial Intelligence.  The well-known computer program called {% wp ELIZA "ELIZA" %} was specifically created to pass the Turing test for example.

Tragedy
-------
Alas, even with all his famous works and fabulous mind, he was caught by one of the twists Fate is known for: Turing was gay at a moment when it was still illegal to be so in the United Kingdom.  He was given the choice of prison or probation, provided that he undergo chimical treatment.  He also was thrown out of any work for GCHQ and even denied visit in the USA {% Remember this was during the "Cold War" and people were paranoid about Russia and spies.  Such "immorality" could be used to force people to spy…{% endfnin %}.

Alan Turing, one of our last geniuses, died in 1954, apparently from suicide, killed by stupidity of the worst kind.

The world had to wait a long time to see him officially pardonned by Her Majesty the Queen in [Dec. 2013](http://cryptome.org/2013/12/turing-pardon.pdf).

Conclusion
----------
I will go see the movie of course, it just came out here in France.  There have been several movies already but not centered that much on Turing himself.  It will be interesting to see I think.
