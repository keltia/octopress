Slightly less busy day during the second run of devsummit sessions, although the ones in the morning were pretty important for us.
<!--more-->
The first one was about the various new tools we have introduced in our development workflow like [Phabricator](https://reviews.freebsd.org/) for dealing with code reviews and discussions around commits and [Jenkins](https://jenkins.freebsd.org/) for Continuous Integration (mainly runs of compiling ports and various branches in the source tree).

Next we had a session on [DNS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) and how we use it in FreeBSD, both for serving zones and resolving names.  [DNSSEC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions) is also very important, especially now that we have a validating resolver in base ([Unbound](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbound_(DNS_server)).

During the afternoon, we had an interesting discussion with [John-Mark Gurney](https://twitter.com/encthenet) about all things crypto inside FreeBSD such as the Open Crypto framework, different algorithms and evolution (such as optimizing [SHA-256](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) which is pretty important for [ZFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS)).

During the evening, we had our second social event in a restaurant in the mountains with some local singing and dance, see the pictures and videos [here](http://assets.keltia.net/photos/EuroBSDCon-2014/Social1/index.html)
