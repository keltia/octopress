Slightly less busy day during the second run of devsummit sessions, although the ones in the morning were pretty important for us.
<!--more-->
The first one was about the various new tools we have introduced in our development workflow like [Phabricator](https://reviews.freebsd.org/) for dealing with code reviews and discussions around commits and [Jenkins](https://jenkins.freebsd.org/) for Continuous Integration (mainly runs of compiling ports and various branches in the source tree).

Next we had a session on {% wp Domain_Name_System "DNS" %} and how we use it in FreeBSD, both for serving zones and resolving names.  {% wp Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions "DNSSEC" %} is also very important, especially now that we have a validating resolver in base ({% wp Unbound_(DNS_server) "Unbound" %}).

During the afternoon, we had an interesting discussion with [John-Mark Gurney](https://twitter.com/encthenet) about all things crypto inside FreeBSD such as the Open Crypto framework, different algorithms and evolution (such as optimizing {% wp SHA-2 "SHA-256" %}) which is pretty important for {% wp ZFS %}).

During the evening, we had our second social event in a restaurant in the mountains with some local singing and dance, see the pictures and videos [here](http://assets.keltia.net/photos/EuroBSDCon-2014/Social1/index.html)
