So today was the first day of the [EuroBSDCOn 2014](http://2014.eurobsdcon.org/) conference, traditionally starting by two days of [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org/) devsummit, a meeting of FreeBSD developers, talking about various topics and thinking about FreeBSD's future.

At every \*BSD conference like [BSDCan](http://bsdcan.org/) or [AsiaBSDCon](http://asiabsdcon.org/), we host syuch devsummits, it has been very useful over the years to gather FreeBSD developers IRL and get them to talk instead of just exchanging mail...

And we generally fill up entire walls like this:

So the first went fine with several interesting subjects like the future 11.0 features (the ones we could love to have or work on -- see [here for example](http://assets.keltia.net/photos/EuroBSDCon-2014/Devsummit/slides/devsummit-32808.html)), ports and [packages](http://assets.keltia.net/photos/EuroBSDCon-2014/Devsummit/slides/devsummit-32834.html)  (like packaging "base"), [10G Ethernet](http://assets.keltia.net/photos/EuroBSDCon-2014/Devsummit/devsummit-32826.jpg) and others.

We also did a session on [embedded systems](http://assets.keltia.net/photos/EuroBSDCon-2014/Devsummit/slides/devsummit-32842.html) (with everything related to various MIPS and ARM CPUs), including external toolchain support and cross-compilation.

Of course [Groff](https//twitter.com/GrofftheBSDgoat) the goat was there:
