## About myself

My name is Ollivier Robert, also known as "roberto" or "Keltia" in various areas (social media, IRC), around 45 right now.

Working in computer science for more than 30 years now, mostly on [UNIX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix)-based systems like FreeBSD or Linux.

After being an Internet & Security Consultant at at a small but well-known agency called [HSC](http://www.hsc.fr/) between 1994 and 1996, I was hired as Information Security Officer at a european agency called [EUROCONTROL](http://www.eurocontrol.int/) (or ECTL to make it shorter).  Since then, I had several different positions there and am now IT Expert for the SWIM workpackage within the SESAR Programme.

My résumé can be found [here](http://assets.keltia.net/cv-roberto.pdf), more data on my [LinkedIn site](http://linkedin.com/) (see below).

## Areas of interest

My main interests in life, after my family and friends are, in no particular order:

* Reading lots of books, mainly Sci-Fi and Fantasy ones.
I'm a big fan of [J.R.R. Tolkien](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolkien) but [George R.R. Martin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin), [C.S. Friedman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.S._Friedman) and [Patricia Keneally-Morrison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Kennealy-Morrison) are among my favorites (you will understood why my domain is named <em>Keltia</em> …).  Recently, I've read novels from [Anne Bishop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Bishop), the writing is not so great but I like the story and characters; and the Vlad Thaltos novels from [Steven Brust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Brust) for fun.  More recently, I've read novels from [Lynn Flewelling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Flewelling) (incl. _The Bone Doll's Twin_ and its following).  Self-publishing is all the rage now, especially for ebooks and [Lindsay Buroker](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4512224.Lindsay_Buroker) is one of them, steam-punk kind of fantasy, I like her a lot.

My Goodread profile with most of my books is [there](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3581338-ollivier).

* [Cryptography](https://www.keltia.net/topics/cryptography) has been of interest to me even before I owned my first computer (a ZX-81 if you want to know) back in 1980… My list of previously owned computers include an Oric Atmos, a Sinclair QL and various PCes.

* Typography is also something I'm interested in, mostly French but also English as well.  That includes fonts and how to write correctly.

* I listen to music all the time.  My favourite band is [Dead Can Dance](http://deadcandance.com/), closely followed by old songs from Deep Purple, Genesis, Jethro Tull and even some Hard Rock/Metal like Metallica, Iron Maiden and Apocalyptica.  I also like the music from Pat Benatar, Loreena McKennitt.

* Cats, I just love them.

## PGP keys

NEW GPG Key!  Please use only this [one there](https://www.keltia.net/keys/8BE879B028731E1C.asc) from now on.

The old one below uses all the bad keysizes/algorithms that are referenced [here](https://we.riseup.net/riseuplabs+paow/openpgp-best-practices#openpgp-key-checks).  Check your own!

    pub   4096R/0x8BE879B028731E1C 2013-09-23 [expires: 2023-09-21]
    uid                 [ultimate] Ollivier Robert <roberto@FreeBSD.org>
    uid                 [ultimate] Ollivier Robert <roberto@keltia.net>
    uid                 [ultimate] Ollivier Robert <roberto@keltia.freenix.fr>
    uid                 [ultimate] [jpeg image of size 4268]
    sub   4096R/0x13B4B0E43FD6021F 2013-09-23 [expires: 2023-09-21]

My *old-old-do-not-use-any-more* GPG key is the following:

    pub   1024D/7DCAE9D3 1997-08-21
    uid                  Ollivier Robert <roberto@keltia.freenix.fr>
    uid                  Ollivier Robert <roberto@keltia.net>
    uid                  Ollivier Robert <roberto@FreeBSD.org>
    sub   2048g/C267084D 1997-08-21

You can find it on the current PGP servers like pgp.mit.edu or [here](https://www.keltia.net/keys/7DCAE9D3.asc) but I do not recommend you to use it.

## Security stuff

You can also find stuff on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/roberto), a new site aiming to do "crypto for the masses".
